# acgan_and_dragan_anime_creation

This is a PyTorch implementation of Towards the Automatic Anime Characters Creation with Generative Adversarial Networks.
The architecture used ACGAN and DRAGAN.

I think there are a few problems with hyper parameters tuning as some noise works really well but most of them give artifacts.
Or there might be something wrong with my code. I will try to trouble shoot it more.

Work in progress.
